Pascal Triangle is used in combinatorics to determine the total amount of possible combinations one can make. Its mathematical definition is a triangular expression that tells the coefficients in the expansion of any binomial expression 
Ex: Making the number of characters with certain given shapes and/or specific objects on a movie, cast, show, etc. #PixarMovies #Wall-E
By creating the pascal triangle we may illustrate all the possibilities in one's ideas with the right restrictions of objects.
